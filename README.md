# Word-Guess-Game

This project is a javascript version of the classic hangman game. It starts with the computer generating a random word that is represented with underscores replacing each character. The player has 15 chances to guess all of the letters in the word. The player inputs letters with their keyboard. When a letter is correct, the underscore with the corresponding letter reveals that letter. If the guessed letter is not in the word, it uses up one of the chances without replacing any underscores. If the player runs out of chances with underscores remaining, they lose the game. If the player reveals all the letters before the run out of chances, they win the game and get 1 point towards "wins". Then the computer randomly generates another word to guess.
